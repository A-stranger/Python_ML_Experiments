0, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Creb,5.0,A Book for the Ages,1,"          This book, translated by Stephen Mitchell, is a work of art.  Some Chinese scholars have criticized Mitchell's translation as not being ""true"" to the original Chinese text.  However, for the lay reader, this criticism misses the mark.  First, any ancient work relies on manuscripts that were written well after the original texts and during this gap the original text(s) were undoubtedly edited or suffered transcription errors.  This is as true of the Tao Te Ching as it is for the Gospels.  Secondly, the original manuscripts very likely relied on an oral history which is forever beyond our reach.  In this sense, the Tau Te Ching might be compared to ""Q"" in the Gospels.  Thirdly, and this applies to all ancient books of wisdom, it is not possible for a person of the twenty-first century to place themselves in 5th century BCE China (or first century Palestine for that matter).  There are just too many fundamental differences, including but not limited to language, science and technology, life span, economics, customs, values, and social organization.  We experience the world in a particular context and our cultural lenses limit our capacity to perceive the world the way others who lived in a vastly different culture did.  So, from my perspective, it is as futile to seek the original and ""true"" meaning of the Tao Te Ching as t is try to understand what it is like to be a bat (Thomas Nagle).  Mitchell is sensitive to the mountain of challenges in translating this ancient text and candid regarding the methods and texts he relied on.  Among all of these methods he shares it was his fourteen years of intensive Zen (Ch'an) training, which ""...brought me face to face with Lau Tzu and his true deciples and heirs, the early Chinese Zen Masters"".  He never tried to merely translate Lau Tzu's words but rather to translate his ""mind"".  In the end, each reader will have to decide for themselves the value that this book holds for them.  There are many translations to chose from and it is prudent to read others as well.  For me, this translation is a masterpiece, a book that I treasure, and one that I will read again and again...Finally, I want to comment on this particular publication of the Tao Te Ching.  This hard bound, illustrated volume was published in 1999 by France's Lincoln Ltd.  The most complementary thing I can say is that the publisher produced a book that is worthy of the text.  The illustrations, compiled by Stephen Little, beautifully compliment the text and provide an ambiance for contemplation.  I almost never purchase a physical book and rely on my tablet for virtually all of my reading.  But not this time.  This is a book to hold in your hands and savor.  ",37,United States ,2019-09-14
1, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,SLC Resident,2.0,pop-culture translation,1,"          I bought this short volume hoping to learn humbly from its ancient wisdom.  However, I learned as I read it that the words in this translation have been modified from the author's original ideas to fit what the translator apparently feels are modern popular sensitivities.  I could tolerate some of that, but when I read the line in the 46th chapter ""the factories make trucks and tractors,"" I realized that this translator was making no attempt to be faithful to the original ideas, but was using his own modern terminology to appeal to pop audiences, as clearly trucks and tractors were not made in factories over two thousand years ago.  As a reader, I feel that it is disingenuous of a translator to portray himself simply as a translator and not a commentator or interpreter if he changes the author's writings to meet what the commentator considers politically correct today and to try to appeal to modern audiences by actually changing references and words to words that the original author would never have understood.  If this doesn't bother you and you simply want a vague understanding of what Lao Tzu wanted to convey, then this book should suffice.  If, however, you seek a true translation of what this great teacher taught, I suggest that you look elsewhere for a more accurate translation.  ",10,United States ,2021-06-28
2, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Fiona Webster,5.0,my favorite rendition of the Tao! and it's not sexist; plus GORGEOUSLY illustrated,1,"          I might quibble with a few of Michell's renditions of the Tao te Ching, but I won't, because his poetry is so exquisite, this is niw my favorite version. It makes no difference that he crafted this version not by translating directly from the Chinese, but by comparing many different sources in European languages. I especially like it that it's not sexist: since Chinese makes no difference between ""he"" and ""she"" or ""his"" and ""her,"" and since the Chinese word for ""Master"" can refer to a person of either sex, Mitchell has wisely chosen to render half the verses that refer to the Master with female pronouns. And the paintings used for the illustrations are so varied and gorgeous and beautifully reproduced, they really add to the impact of the words!  ",11,United States ,2019-02-22
3, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Seijinvet,5.0,Beautiful Rendering,1,"          I am a theologian, amongst other things, and recently have been pursuing a personal interest in looking for common denominators in the major world religions. Taoism is one, and I wanted this book as a source a bit more aesthetically pleasing than a PDF copied and printed from the internet.  Now some other Christian theologians would have kittens for someone even examining such things, but this book, as a work of art, is beautiful, and a welcome addition to my library.  ",6,United States ,2021-01-08
4, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Amazon Customer,5.0,The most powerful book I have seen.,1,"          I have read this through many times and will keep on reading it.  This wisdom is so powerful that it truly changes the way you look at the world.  Before reading this book I didn't know what wisdom was.  It seems that wisdom is stepping back and seeing through the eyes of compassion.  Seeing like an infant that doesn't even know what vision is.  The Tao Te Ching is filled with paradoxical truths.  Prepare for your ego to be vanquished and you true self released.This version by Stephen Mitchell is my favorite.  He didn't try to translate the words but instead the wisdom.  English and Chinese just aren't very compatible.  I will trade accuracy for readability any day, especially when I am giving this book away to people all the time.  The hardcover and the presentation are beautiful making it an excellent gift.  People give me a lot of feedback when I give this to them, they aren't just putting in on the shelf.  When they quote it I know it is making a difference in their lives.  Having access to Lou Tzu's wisdom is kind of like being in a club that is special because you become immune to the endless attempts by the mind to deceive you.  ",29,United States ,2015-05-09
5, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Amazon Customer,1.0,Not the Stephen Mithce,1,"          The author is not listed on the listing, but several of the reviews mentioned that it was a the Stephen Mitchell translation.  That’s why I bought it. But it’s not the Stephen Mitchell translation. It’s translated by a guy named James Legge!  This is some kind of Taoist bait and switch.  I did not get the book I wanted.  ",4,United States ,2020-04-05
6, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Mike,5.0,A top version of the Tao Teh Ching,1,"          Very carefully made book, translations and interpretations are not very literal/word-for-word, but this is neither good nor bad, it is both. John C. Wu, I feel has a more accurate and literal translation that is typically more thorough. However, Mitchell seems to be quite familiar with Eastern thought as a whole, not just in Taoism, but also Zen Buddhism. Therefore, in some way this may add or take away from the Tao Teh Ching. Some of his interpretations are quite simple and beautiful. However, when I compare some passages to Wu's version, he seems to have left out a lot of content. It is unclear, however, if Wu even has the ""correct"" or ""original"" version of the Tao Teh Ching to translate in the first place. It is my understanding that there many different versions and interpretations of this book even among Buddhists in Asia. The extra you get with this book is the Asian art and it feels larger and richer than other books I've browsed.  ",6,United States ,2014-12-07
7, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Razzmatazz,5.0,Beautiful inside and out,1,"          This is the first translation of the Tao Te Ching I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was drawn to this edition, because I saw so much praise for Stephen Mitchell's translation (despite the liberties he apparently took with it) and I figured it couldn't hurt to have beautiful artwork alongside my wisdom. Even though it seems likely that this translation should not be taken too seriously as a historical representation of the text, it flows quite well and provides a calming spiritual message.As for the Frances Lincoln illustrated edition, it really is a beautiful book with a beautiful handscroll cover and backing that goes along with all of the artwork inside. This book is somewhat large for casual reading and the pages are glossy--if that would affect anyone's decision to buy this version.  ",1,United States ,2015-12-19
8, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Jim Foley,4.0,A beautiful and reader-friendly translation,1,"          Each of the many translations of this Taoist classic has its own slightly-different spirit and meaning.  If you're new to the Tao Te Ching, this is a good version to read, and you'll probably feel it was time well spent.  The original text contains many mystical, paradoxical statements which pose certain translation challenges, as well as some passages that were intended as advice for powerful rulers that seems cynical, not spiritual.  For instance, the first thing the text tells us that the Way that can be told is not the Way, which can sound ridiculous if badly expressed.  And we're told that rulers should do as little as possible to avoid conflict, and should keep their subjects' brains empty and their stomachs full to prevent them from rebelling.  This version works harder than some others to make the whole thing seem understandable, beautiful, and spiritual, and it largely succeeds.  I don't read Chinese and am not a scholar, so I don't know which translation is most accurate.  This one is pleasant and has beautiful pictures.  I use it sometimes in the morning as part of preparing for the day.  ",1,United States ,2015-02-02
9, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,david ready,3.0,Certainly not the best of interpretations/translations available,1,"          Certainly not the best of interpretations/translations available.  My objection is with the author's choice of ""illustrations"".  I am unable to understand why he would use trite European art to embellish the text.  They add nothing to the book, have no bearing to the translation/interpretation.It is nice to have Amazon's Kindle.  ",8,United States ,2017-09-06
10, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Henry Evans,5.0,An Excellent Rendering For The 21st Century,1,"          Several centuries back Basho wrote a haiku about a frog jumping into a pond.  Today you can find literally dozens of English translations of this poem stretching back across the centuries, and many of them (though different) are very good though each revision is in some fashion or another grounded in the place and time of its translator.I start this way so that I can suggest that Stephen Mitchell's translation is a very modern one...it is written for us in this century.  I do not agree with all of Mitchell's substitutions, his ""betrayals"" if you will, but what results, I feel, is a book that excellently encapsulates the essence of the Way in words and phrases that we moderns can readily grasp on to.It is also a beautiful book.I would not want to have it as my only copy of the Tao Te Ching, but I would want to have it.  ",1,United States ,2013-08-29
11, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,kimberlyj,5.0,The Way of 'No way',1,"          This book allows me great peace. It's prose and philosophis can change ones perceptions towards 'allowance'.From force of will and resistance based (egoic) operating ~to a more graceful way of ""no way"" within through quiet (heart) observance of all ~in nature.. as 'a river flows on past any branches, over rocks towards its goal of meeting in tI'm of no time with the sea..

12, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,A. Christi,5.0,Great Gift of Love for life and the Soul,1,"          I treasure this book which I bought on Amazon in hardback 2 years or so ago. I still pick it up almost daily, and miss it when I leave it behind. I get new and deeper meaning from the vibration of the words each time. I just read a review that rated it as 1 star-- I, myself, could care less about its technical aspects being 'right' or 'wrong' or whatever else--all I know is it keeps helping me open my heart more and more--accepting all things, all people, and life as it is, as all is one.I have recently spent a lot of time with Byron Katie's ""A thousand names of Joy"" -- as she translates this book into her own enlightened version -- I could embody the gift of the Tao much deeper -- I am grateful for this husband and wife team!  A Thousand Names for Joy: Living in Harmony with the Way Things Are          I also bought the CD, as I am on the road a lot and can listen over and over until the deepest essence of the words/vibration sink in. When I hear it I know it is truth... it is just being able to live it always.  ",3,United States ,2009-10-13
13, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Jack Edward Heald,5.0,"Beautiful Translation, Beautiful Book",1,          This has become my favorite translation of the Tao Te Ching.I read it almost every day.And the art work is simply astonishing.I wish there was a way to buy selected prints of the art.Amazing. Just amazing.If you are a fan of the Tao Te Ching - or of Taoist art - I guarantee you will love this book.  ,0,United States ,2019-02-07
14, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Josiah Alliss,4.0,Great book! I must recommend,1,"          Strictly on the quality and presentation of this book not the contents. This is about 90 pages and paperback but I love the way it feels in my hands. It is thin but it feels like a good quality book other than there was a minor defect in the front cover, it appears to be a crease of some kind. I received my copy a day early and am very excited to get into the contents! This was overall a very satisfying purchase especially for the price!  ",0,United States ,2021-02-11
15, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,nick,5.0,Great Text,1,"          I bought this for a class on eastern philosophy and it really is pretty amazing; it is the type of text you can speed through (because it is essentially a series of poems/proverbs), or that you can spend the rest of your life studying and then trying to ""put into practice"" in various different ways. This version is translated by Mitchell (Amazon sells identical translations) except this one is illustrated with beautiful artwork, so if it is for a class, i would buy this one (i actually bought both because i tend to mark up my texts and wanted a clean copy as well). Whatever the reason the Tao Te Ching interests you, i recommend the artwork version - it just seems to add something and, if nothing else, it gives you something nice to look at as you contemplate the teachings of Lao-tzu.

16, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,ARNOLD BREIS,5.0,The illustrations are wonderful and just enhances the beauty of the work,1,"          The most lucid book ever written regarding attaining a fulfilled life. This is a transliteration and not a direct translation. It doesn't matter. As someone who has practiced Tai Chi for over 30 years, the Tao Te Ching by Stephen Mitchell is right on in meaning and a guide to what is possible. The illustrations are wonderful and just enhances the beauty of the work. I hardily recommend this book to anyone seeking the truth about living in the here and now. In addition, it makes a wonderful gift to anyone who is seeking a fulfilled life.  ",2,United States ,2014-08-04
17, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Martha A.,1.0,Disappointed,1,          I personally didn’t like the translation of it. It was by a guy named James Legge and you can tell it’s roughly translated if you’ve read other versions. I tried to return it and amazon gave me a refund or they are in the process of it which I really am thankful for. I just don’t know what to do with the book. Also if anyone’s curious the first line is “The tao that can be described is not the enduring and unchanging tao” I feel like the first line tele you the translation style  ,0,United States ,2021-05-09
18, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Scarson,3.0,GOING ON A JOURNEY OF SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT,1,"          Having studied various religions, I did like this book and the gorgeous interpretations and artwork inside, the message was great as well but not spectacular. I am comparing this to my studies of the Bible, the Hindi scriptures and various other religious texts. It didn't delve as deep as I wished it would have in spirituality, more a book just telling you how/how not to live, but I am more than happy that I purchased it to add to my collection on humanities religious texts. Hope this helps!  ",2,United States ,2014-01-17

The cloth texture is printed. I can't seem to care, though, as I am so very pleased with what is inside the cover.  ",1,United States ,2015-03-16
20, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Kelly,3.0,A difficult version to understand.,1,"          This paperback book is beautiful and of good quality, however,  the interpretation of this version is very difficult to understand.  Notes on the interpretations are often right in the middle of the verse which interrupts the flow. I have read three different interpretations of the Tao te Ching.

27, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Judy Roberts,5.0,Brought me to tears,1,"          I LOVE this book.Unlike some other reviewers, who have read several translations of the Tao Te Ching, I have read it for the first time.While I was reading, a thought crossed my mind, ""Under which rock have I been hiding for sixty years?  Why have I found this book only now?""Of course that judgmental thought in itself is out of sync with the Tao which, like the ocean, accepts whatever flows into it, whenever that may happen.Suffice it to say, I am extremely grateful to have stumbled on the wisdom of Lao Tzu.There are so many compliments to pay this book.  Where to begin?  Lao Tzu provided the content, which is simple yet profound.  Stephen Mitchel has provided a translation that is elegant and poetic.I was going to say that this would be my choice if I was allowed to take one book to that proverbial desert island.  But then it occurred to me that, having read this one, I would have no need of books.  Its message is inscribed in my heart - and that always goes with me.All the same, as long as I haven't yet been stranded on that island, I'm sure I'll return to this gem repeatedly, to savour its beauty and no doubt to discover fresh insights on subsequent readings.Potential customers who, like me, have not read the Tao Te Ching, may be interested to know how I found out about it.  I'd read ""A Thousand Names for Joy : Living in Harmony with the Way Things Are"" (Byron Katie's commentary on excerpts from the Tao Te Ching)  and, before that, ""Loving What Is : Four Questions That Can Change Your Life"" (which describes 'The Work' of Byron Katie).  I'd found those books supportive too.  ",1,United States ,2013-01-15

29, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Wally Jasper,2.0,A pre-digested rendition/interpretation/commentary,1,"          First of all, this is not a translation of the Tao Te Ching; it is a loose rendition/interpretation/commentary of the great work by Lao Tzu. As such, well, it is what it is. It gives some of the flavor, some hints of the meaning, and even sometimes, a sense of Lao Tzu's style and imagery. However, if you are looking for translations that follow the original more closely, that often speak through imagery and metaphor, that sometimes seem perplexing to our mentally constructed way of thinking, you would do well to look elsewhere.I've been reading Mitchell's rendition concurrently, stanza by stanza, with versions by Gia-fu Feng/Jane English and by Ursula Le Guin, both of which are more similar to each other than to Mitchell's version. These latter two are spare, they contain much imagery and metaphor, and they leave a lot unsaid, undigested so that the reader must reach beyond the thinking mind to grasp ineffable truths. Mitchell, on the other hand, lays it all out with his own understanding. But in doing this he takes grossly excessive liberties with the text. He's basically just presenting his understanding of what he thinks Lao Tzu really wanted to say, kind of like pre-digested pablum that is fed to infants. It reads like commonplace generic New Age consensus mind-speak. This approach diminishes Lao Tzu's teaching. I myself prefer the less digested, less pre-packaged versions. (Between the Feng/English and Le Guin versions, I prefer Le Guin's. It is poetical, direct, spontaneous and sometimes playful. Fresh.) For those looking for a more authentic Tao Te Ching, you may want to continue your search; compare various versions before just going with the most popular.  ",2,United States ,2016-04-14
30, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Laura,5.0,A beautiful rendition of Lao Tzu,1,"          If you are a lover of Lao Tzu, you will joy in this exquisite book.

The beautiful art in this version is a great companion to the eternal wisdom within the pages of this epic. Throughout the journey of my own introspection no one piece of wisdom has been at my side more than the Tao te Ching, and it is an gift to see the Way in this light. The Tao te Ching speaks to everybody on many different levels of understanding. The Tao is a book that is felt rather than intellectualized, and it can be read in its entirity in one afternoon yet contemplated for a lifetime.  ",2,United States ,2011-12-22

Where are you going? What are you trying to accomplish? What is better left alone than rushed or forced?In soliditarity with basic tenets of Buddhism, Taoism accepts nature and the progression of life events as they are without human muddling or interference. Tao does not force anyone to bend to its will, but exists outside of human interpretation of it. Readers can guess, but must remain satisfied with not having answers to every inquiry.

Just some short statements of profound wisdom.  If you are interested in Asian philosophy just get it.I think that it's particularly useful for people going through rough times and difficulties.

But each page is worth meditating on, as each lesson really has lifelong practicality.  A lovely book, beautiful illustrations, & so quick & easy to get through.  You could really read the entire thing in a short sitting!  But then, go back & take your time...absorb it...there is so much being said in the short paragraphs.  Happy journey!

Nice and smooth paper, with beautiful and very in-tune Chinese brush arts.Nonetheless, only after reading it for a while, I realized that this is not Tao de Ching at all. OMG, it's more different from the original than the Disney adapted ""Mulan"" ! For a movie, it might be okay. But for a philosophy work... The most interesting thing of reading Tao-deching is to see what the greatest thinker was thinking in 2600 years ago, when we have not been completed tamed by the upper structures of civilization!Stephen Mitchell, who is this guy...Wikipedia said he doesn't even know Chinese, how could he translate something written in very ancient classic Chinese?For example, in Chapter 46, in Chinese it says ""When  a country is in harmony with Tao, warhorses work in the field for farmers, when a country is not in harmony with Tao, even pregnant warhorses went to war-field, and have to given birth of ponies there""In Mitchell's version (this book), it says""When a country ... with Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors....""Future, the following paragraph saying all the stuff about ""fear"", where the original text is about ""knowing enough"". For the conclusion, Mitchell writes that ""whoever can see through all fear will always be safe"". What is this? ""Chicken soup for the soul"" ? Taodeching actually says "" therefore the sufficiency of knowing sufficiency is an eternal sufficiency""...I'm a Chinese, originally I planned to send this to a friend, now I decided to rewrite the translation from others (like that by Charles Muller) on the nice paper of this book.

179, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Dennis Littrell,5.0,"Beautiful book, worth owning",1,"          There are several books by the amazing Stephen Mitchell on the ""Tao Te Ching."" The two that I know--this one and his Harper Perennial ""Tao Te Ching"" (2006)--use his free-flowing and poetic translation from 1988. This book is also distinguished by the beautiful artwork on Taoist themes selected by Stephen Little.Mitchell is a master at turning religious works into contemporary English poetry while being essentially true to the original. Noteworthy is his graceful translation of the Gita in ""Bhagavad Gita: A New Translation"" (2000). However Mitchell does not know Chinese and therefore in effect is interpreting translations augmented by his scholarship and literary experience. Some people find this off-putting but I think it's okay as long as you are not looking for most faithful to the ""original"" rendering.I have read the Tao in several English translations (or renderings) and I can say that Mitchell's is one of the best. By ""best"" I mean as a work of religious literature that is essentially true to the meaning and spirit of the original. It is interesting in this regard to note that Mitchell wrote that ""...the most essential preparation for my work was a fourteen-year-long course of Zen training, which brought me face to face with Lao-tzu and his true disciples and heirs, the early Chinese Zen Masters.""Mitchell adds (in true Taoist paradoxical style) ""With great poetry, the freest translation is sometimes the most faithful... If I haven't always translated Lao-tzu's words, my intention has always been to translate his mind."" (The quotes are from the Foreword he wrote for the Harper Perennial book mentioned above.)A nearly instant test of a rendering of the ""Tao"" is a quick look at the opening couplet and at one or two of the most famous chapters. Here's Mitchell's opening couplet:""The tao that can be toldis not the eternal TaoThe name that can be namedis not the eternal Name.""For comparison let's look at some other translations. Here's J. Legge's version (from ""Sacred Books of the East,"" Volume 39 1891):""The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name.""There's a clear difference in the first line. Mitchell writes of the tao being told (small ""t"" indicating not the eternal Tao) while Legge refers to a ""Tao"" that can be walked upon not being the real unchanging Tao.Since I don't read Chinese I don't know which is truer to the original text--or actually texts since translators who do read the Chinese characters typically rely on several versions. The simple truth is nobody knows what the ""original"" ""Tao Te Ching"" looked like. In fact it almost certainly came down from an earlier oral tradition. Consequently a free translation may indeed be the ""best.""Okay, let's now look at another translation of the first two lines, this time by Derek Lin from his book, ""Tao Te Ching: Annotated and Explained"" (2006):""The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal TaoThe name that can be named is not the eternal name""This is virtually the same as Mitchell's rendering.One more, this time from Robert G. Henricks' ""Lao-Tzu Te-Tao Ching: A New Translation Based on the Recently Discovered Ma-Wang-Tui Texts"" (1989):As for the Way, the Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way;As for names the name that can be named is not the constant name.""This examination of fine points of course is contrary to the Way (not to mention Zen) now that I think about it. Still it is fun to do. So let's do one more. Here are Mitchell's first few lines of the famous Chapter 41:""When a superior man hears of the Tao,he immediately begins to embody it.When an average man hears of the Tao,he half believes it, half doubts it.When a foolish man hears of the Tao,he laughs out loud.If he didn't laugh,it wouldn't be the Tao.""Here's Legge's version:Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao,earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, whenthey have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it.Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laughgreatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fitto be the Tao.And here is Lin's version:""Higher people hear of the TaoThey diligently practice itAverage people hear of the TaoThey sometimes keep it and sometimes lose itLower people hear of the TaoThey laugh loudly at itIf they do not laugh, it would not be the Tao""My vote is for Mitchell's ""freer"" version.One of the things I don't like about Mitchell's translation is his alternative use of the pronouns ""he"" and ""she."" It's a shame that English does not have a gender neutral first person singular; however I think that, since the ""Tao Te Ching"" is the most feminine of all the great religious works of the world added to the fact that the Tao is itself considered feminine, Mitchell should have gone exclusively with ""she.""Finally what I want to say is that what Mitchell brings to the translation of the ""Tao Te Ching"" is vast poetic and spiritual experience. When he says he was ""face to face"" with Lao-tzu he means that everything he had learned in his life up to that time allowed him to understand the old master in a way that a less experienced person could not.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)""  ",1,United States ,2013-06-16
180, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,tepi,5.0,Somehow I don't think Old Master Lao would mind.,1,"          I was a bit bothered by Stephen Mitchell's version at first, but after spending more time with it begin to have second thoughts.  It's true  that he hasn't given us a literal reading of Lao Tzu's text.  He's dropped bits here and there, and seems to have sneaked in a few bits  of his own.  But hey!  Surely a guy who has survived fourteen years of Zen torture, erh... training, has earned some rights?In effect what Mitchell has done is to give us a stripped-down and  modernized re-working of the Tao Te Ching.  This strategy has led to  some very real benefits.  Most of the obscurer parts, parts that even have Chinese scholars scratching their heads, seem to have pretty well gone.  Also gone is the wordiness that finds its way into so many  other translations.  What remains is the essence, and it stands  out clearly.Frankly I don't think you'll miss much of Lao Tzu's message of simplicity, patience, compassion.  No important notion seems to have  been lost.  And Mitchell's language has a wonderful simplicity and directness.  Here's an example chosen at random from Chapter 9, with  my slash marks to indicate line breaks:""Chase after money and security / and your heart will never unclench. / Care about people's approval / and you will be their prisoner.""These are important truths.  Two of the many in this text that we do  well to keep in mind.  And ""unclench"" -- the grasping heart as a tight clenched fist -- is a very nice touch. Of course, it isn't  exactly what Lao Tzu said.  But somehow I don't  think Old Master Lao would mind.  In fact, he'd probably feel honored  by the paintings too.  ",7,United States ,2001-05-16

The teachings are lovely and quite thought provoking and the artwork in this particular version is also quite lovely.  This book was recommended to me by a friend and as I'm a great lover of the library, where I first found this book, I purchased this particular version to have in my personal library for many years of philosophical discovery with each time I've re-read it.  As far as reading, the entire book could likely be read in about an hour, yet with the wealth of knowledge and depth of philosophy, also allows one to read one page at a time, and that may also be enough for one to ponder upon for some time.  Excellent book - I own the hard cover to preserve the art as well.  ",0,United States ,2015-12-30
182, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Swing King,5.0,Fresh perspective on this widely translated ancient text,1,"          Stephen Mitchell, editor of Dropping Ashes on the Buddha by Zen master Seung Sahn, delivers us a magnificently illustrated and lyrically fluid rendition of Lao Tzu's famous work. You know, this book has been translated so many times, that it's nearly impossible for us non scholars to prove or confirm which one is true or absolute. The approach I have taken with The Tao Te Ching has always been a task of comparing one translation to another, seeing both what they share in common together and where there is a disparity. I am partial to The Richard Wilhelm Edition, while second on my list is this one. Mitchell has taken the liberty of alternating back and forth ""he"" with the word ""she"" throughout this work in order to convey the original meaning of Master. For, in the Chinese language, no such distinction is made. Mitchell points out that since each one of us is essentially the ""Master"", there is no need to cling to some kind of male prototype. It's his translation, and he is free to do what he will with it. The shattering of dualism found throughout The Tao Te Ching, to myself, makes it clear this switch is wholly in the spirit of Tao.Mitchell attributes his Zen training as being the primary reason he feels he relates to those ancient Chinese Taoist masters. After all, Zen is merely the literal result of Indian Vipassana meditation and Chinese Taoism intermingling. Stephen also used existent translations already established in a wide range of languages: English, French, and German. Now I probably wouldn't recommend this as the first translation of The Tao Te Ching for a ""beginner"" to read, but I'm by no means against the idea, either. It's not like it's injurious,  and the prose is quite correct. I find this work in the same spirit as mostly all of the other versions I have read to date, with only slight variations. Needless to say, I really enjoyed this book immensely. I think you'll walk away with something, too.  ",8,United States ,2004-02-27
183, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Grady Harp,5.0,As Visually  Beautiful a Journey as Spiritual,1,"          Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching (The Book of the Way)  has long been referenced by those who seek to understand the Eastern philosophy of the harmony of the universe.  In simple, eloquent verse this collection of poems (though there are those who would object to the 'poem' label) the secrets to shedding the self with its attendant judgment, desire, and critique provide the guide for finding oneness with the cosmos.Steven Mitchell is the translator of these ancient texts and his sensitivity to the poetic flow of the concepts and instructions enhance this version of the TAO TE CHING.  And as if that weren't sufficient reason to make this your access to these ageless meditations, this book is an 'illustrated version', tastefully combined with old Chinese drawings and paintings that allow the eye to roam while digesting the moments of beauty of the words.This book becomes a constant companion for those who look to make sense of the world and its chaos.  If ever there were the perfect gift for the friends in your life, this elegant little book is surely one of the best.  Grady Harp, March 05.  ",13,United States ,2005-03-24
184, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Dr. H. A. Jones,4.0,The ancient Chinese mystical text,1,"          Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, translated by Stephen Mitchell, Frances Lincoln, London, 1999.This is one of a number of translations now available of the Chinese mystical text written or assembled by the school of Lao Tzu around the 5th or 6th century BCE. I have read and reviewed a number of translations of this text. They all have something worthwhile to say. Which version resonates with a reader depends primarily on the accuracy and spiritual insight of the translator and secondly, but importantly, on the publisher's flair for producing a book that is inspiring to read and handle with beautiful illustrations.  This version is gloriously illustrated on every double-page spread with sepia-tone Chinese paintings chosen by Asian art expert Dr Stephen Little, and the text is a version that I find inspiring. This is one of the versions I would recommend for anyone who wishes to undertake the spiritual journey that lies at the root of Taoism.As I have said in my other reviews of this text, which version appeals to you as reader will differ from one to another. The message of the main eastern mystical philosophies is essentially the same: to accept what life has to offer; to look always for the best in any person and life situation, even those that present difficulties, challenges and unhappiness in the short term; to take time out from our pressured life-styles for quiet reflection and meditation; to be always aware that there is an overriding spirituality that interacts with us in every moment of our being, a spirituality that we enhance or undermine by our thoughts and actions. This is the overall message of the Tao.A certain degree of interpretation is inevitable in any translation, but for readers seeking a more expansive text than just a straightforward translation of the Tao and one that you might find relates more directly to everyday life in the west, there are commendable interpretations by Byron Katie and by Wayne Dyer available. Personally, I prefer the straight translation that I can meditate on and interpret in a way most relevant to my own life. There are also other direct translations by Chad Hansen, by Richard Wilhelm and H.G. Ostwald, by John C.H. Wu and, my favourite, by Ralph Alan Dale.  ",0,United States ,2012-09-01
185, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Daniel,5.0,Gorgeous poetry regardless of your faith,1,"          If every philosophy or religion had a book like this, it would be much easier to appreciate and perhaps even enjoy the diversity of belief among humankind. Mitchell captures the simplicity and straightforwardness of the text, and what we get is a incredibly beautiful book of verse. Some scriptures and cornerstone philosophy texts try to argue their way into your head; the Tao, especially as translated by Mitchell and coupled with stunning artwork, effortlessly works to seduce its way into the core of your being.When you put the book down, you may disagree with many components of the Tao's underlying philosphy. But during the short time you live between the book's covers, it is a joy to enter the rhythmic flow of the Tao and put skepticism on hold.  ",12,United States ,2005-08-25
186, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Andrew Beaulac,4.0,Definitely the Prettiest Tao Te Ching,1,"          I have come to have a fondness and deep appreciation for Mitchell's work and choices of subjects. I bought this translation because of high praise for it hidden in one of Jim Harrison's poems. This version is, perhaps, the most readable of all I have encountered. Many people find it inspiring and that must be why it is such an acclaimed translation.  Having dealt with a dozen or so translations and the texts behind them, I do note that Mitchell takes some liberties. His is a very idiomatic translation, which often reads better than word-for-word literalness, the latter often proving too wooden to be enjoyable or clear. And Mitchell might even omit a few phrases or add one here or there. But the spirit is all Lao Tzu. Also, the volume is full of the most exquisite ancient Chinese illustrations, making it the most beautiful of any of my Tao Te Chings.  ",49,United States ,2005-07-24
187, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,John Camillieri (jdc@prodigy.net),5.0,An existance affirming book anyone can read in an half-hour.,1,"          Caution: This review is on the text only as I have not seen the pictures.I read this book every day. Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching ,(along and in harmony with all the worlds great religious and philosophical texts and  teachings) is one of the most truthful,practical and important manuals on  existance ever written. I have read 7 tranlations and Mitchell's is the  most accesible and beautiful I have ever found. While maintaining its  intrinsic poetic grace, Stephen Mitchell allows the wisdom of one of human  civilizations greates teachers to permeate your being in a gentle non  ridgid way. The book is totally aproachable and its lessons about life and  the true nature of reality are a miracle.Mitchells translation , in a  wonderfully simple and sage like style, illuminates the challenging aspects  of the human condition while simutaneously explaining how to remain  blissfully centered, in the moment and at peace. The martial artist's eye  of the huricane. Lao Tzu's insights on the true workings of the universe  have never been conveyed in a clearer or more digestible way than in  Stephen Mitchells translation.  Its power to display the omnipresent  current that affects (and is) all life and existance is a marvel of  writing. I read it in traffic, I read it in line at the bank, I read it for  pleasure, I read it to acknowledge reality, I read it before and after  practicing Tai-Chi.Put into practice  the wisdom conveyed by Mitchell  will transform your life. You will go through life burning all your fuel  while simutaneously relaxing as you become lovingly enveloped in existance.  A natural outgrowth of practicing the wisdom in this book is to become more  humble, loving, peaceful, self compassionate, forgiving,strong, flexible,  virile and supple.Along with certain books from the Bible I would want  this book if ever imprisoned. Along the same lines if I ever won the  lottery and found myself surrounded by nude supermodels I would want this  book. This book has made me realize that life, regardless of circumstances  may not always be pleasurable but the moments of displeasure are as valid,  important and life-affirming as the moments of ecstasy. By allowing your  consciousness to transcend your senses desire can't touch you. Without  desire your heart opens up.  ",27,United States ,1999-08-21

As you read the Tao you will realize that you already knew the truths spoken of but overlooked them because they were so obvious. A must read for our age. By the way, it's not lite reading. Read only a few passages at a time and then reflect on them. This is one of the few books you can read over and over and still get something ne out of it. Also, I've read many versions of the Tao Te Ching. Many were not translated in to real world terms. Others were....well.... Dumbed down! Of all of these translation this version is by far the best. Real world language while allowing you to draw your own conclusions.Enjoy!  ",17,United States ,2001-11-23

209, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,rcr,1.0,A fabrication,1,"          In his preface and notes which form a part of this book, Mitchell:(1) makes clear his belief that Lao-tzu is a historical person, rather than mythical figure, (2) asserts that the Tao Te Ching (""TTC"") is the work of a single author, Lao-tzu, and (3) states that his ""most essential preparation"" for writing his version of the TTC was a 14 year study of Zen Buddhism, ""which brought me face to face with Lao-tzu and his true disciples, the early Chinese Zen masters.""  As to assertions 1 and 2, for the past 40 years, experts in Taoism (I will define ""experts in Taoism"" as professors in Taoist studies, literate-unlike Mitchell--in classical Chinese, teaching at US, Asian or European universities, who have published books on Taoism) have unanimously agreed that there is a total absence of documentary evidence for the existence of Lao-tzu, and that the TTC is definitely not the work of one author. And the overwhelming majority of experts on Taoism are in agreement that Taoism and Zen Buddhism are NOT identical or substantially identical religions or philosophies.  In a review of Mitchell's TTC in the 10/26/89 issue of ""The Nation,"" the reviewer David Hinton observed "" by my rough estimation, in the course of translating the (TTC)...(approximately 985 lines) Mitchell has rewritten about 150 lines so radically that they bear virtually no relation to the original, has ELIMINATED about 250 lines, and about 170 lines HAVE BEEN INVENTED OUT OF THIN AIR (emphasis added)...Sometimes the inventions replace lines Mitchell has deleted, sometimes they are simply added to what was already there. In either case they correspond to nothing whatsoever in the text...I suppose Mitchell's crowning moment comes in Chapter 50, where lines of his own invention are crowned with commentary by Zen master San Seung.""  For his translations of the works of classical Chinese poets, Hinton subsequently received the top two US poetry translation awards-- the Landon Award and the PEN Award. Stephen Mitchell has not received and will not receive either of these two awards--professional translators, unlike the other Amazon reviewers of this book, understand and reject what Mitchell does, which is fabrication--or more bluntly, the creation of falsehoods.  If Mitchell has produced and passed off on book buyers a work which , contrary to its title, bears little resemblance to the received text, he does reveal truths about his own character. One need only read the TTC lines he has deleted from his version. In Chapter 8, for example, Mitchell deletes the following 3 lines:""In giving, the good thing is being like Heaven/In speaking the good thing is sincerity/In affairs the good thing is ability.""

211, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,nobody,0,,1,"          This is a review for the Stephen Mitchell translation.I was confused at first to go to the Stephen Mitchell translation and see reviewers state it was too academic or had words in parentheses. What has happened is that Amazon, once again, has mashed multiple translations, some are over 100 years old and not very good.If you want my advice and you are just starting out get the Stephen Mitchell translation and read the introduction. The Tao Te Ching doesn't just contain one or two nuggets of wisdom, it is an entire system of thought. How to centre your life in the Dao and what that looks like. To me Mitchell himself is master of this way. I'm not saying he has it all figured out or he understands Loa Tsu perfectly, but he puts things so simply that it's hard not to understand the spirit behind the teachings.Mitchell also authored The Second Book of the Dao, which is a selection from the writings of Zhuangzi. It will help further illuminate the Tao Te Ching and shows just how surprisingly joyful and funny the ancient Daoists were.Perhaps after that you could go in for one of the more modern academic translation like Derek Lin's work, which translates the text literally but poetically and has copious notes throughout. Lin also has a YT channel where he teaches on the Tao Te Ching in depth (two-hour talks on a portion of one chapter!)Please don't give up on the Tao Te Ching because of a poor translation or because it seems difficult to understand. It is by digging that you find the gold. :)  ",38,United Kingdom ,2020-01-06

251, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Dr. H. A. Jones,0,,1,"          Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, translated by Stephen Mitchell, Frances Lincoln, London, 1999.This is one of a number of translations now available of the Chinese mystical text written or assembled by the school of Lao Tzu around the 5th or 6th century BCE. I have read and reviewed a number of translations of this text. They all have something worthwhile to say. Which version resonates with a reader depends primarily on the accuracy and spiritual insight of the translator and secondly, but importantly, on the publisher's flair for producing a book that is inspiring to read and handle with beautiful illustrations.  This version is gloriously illustrated on every double-page spread with sepia-tone Chinese paintings chosen by Asian art expert Dr Stephen Little, and the text is a version that I find inspiring. This is one of the versions I would recommend for anyone who wishes to undertake the spiritual journey that lies at the root of Taoism - but there are many others.As I have said in my other reviews of this text, which version appeals to you as reader will differ from one to another. The message of the main eastern mystical philosophies is essentially the same: to accept what life has to offer; to look always for the best in any person and life situation, even those that present difficulties, challenges and unhappiness in the short term; to take time out from our pressured life-styles for quiet reflection and meditation; to be always aware that there is an overriding spirituality that interacts with us in every moment of our being, a spirituality that we enhance or undermine by our thoughts and actions. This is the overall message of the Tao.A certain degree of interpretation is inevitable in any translation, but for readers seeking a more expansive text than just a straightforward translation of the Tao and one that you might find relates more directly to everyday life in the west, there are commendable interpretations by Byron Katie and by Wayne Dyer available. Personally, I prefer the straight translation that I can meditate on and interpret in a way most relevant to my own life. There are also other direct translations by Chad Hansen, by Richard Wilhelm and H.G. Ostwald, by John C.H. Wu and, my favourite, by Ralph Alan Dale.  ",3,United Kingdom ,2012-08-31

275, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,Carl Henrik Janson,0,,1,"          FRAUD. This book is announced as the kindle version of the Stephen Mitchell translation, which is BTW really completely superior to this one. I don't know if this is intentional from Amazon or not, but it actually looks like a kind of fraud. Completely unacceptable behavior, thinking perhaps that it is more easy to create some extra sales on ebook format? I recommend: Purchase the paper version of the Tao Te Ching: An illustrated journey, or find another vendor offering ebook formats.  ",7,United Kingdom ,2016-03-05
276, Tao Te Ching (Illustrated Journey) ,paula corcoran,0,,1,"          This is not the kindle book I thought I had ordered and paid for, I clicked on Tao Te Ching as translated by Steven Mitchell and this version turned up in my kindle??????  ",1,United Kingdom ,2016-10-03
